## About Hostess

Hostess is a Web Application Framework. It doesn't exist with the purpose of reinventing the wheel, but as a simple structure and with little study time, it is easy to learn and assemble large systems/applications.

All this and two more bonuses:

- Does not depend on Apache / Nginx / PHP-fpm;
- Totally asynchronous.

I believe that development should be an experience of creativity focused on solving real problems. Being created with a small code base, the project is focused on streamlining and bringing efficiency to tasks such as:

- Routes;
- Dependency injection;
- Multiple Session Systems;
- Database ORM
- Background jobs
- Cache

... among others.

## Project evolution:

Hostess is currently under development. It can already be used, experimented, but a lot has yet to evolve, maybe even change completely.
